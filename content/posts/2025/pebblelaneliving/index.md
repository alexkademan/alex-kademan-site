## Overview
			
Pebble Lane was primarily a furniture retailer that has since been absorbed by [Smart Living Home & Garden](https://www.alexkademan.site/work/smartlivinghg/).

I built this website using a now-defunct shopping cart program, and maintained it for several years before it was shut down.

Also I created the logo and managed all branding for the website and all of it's print needs during it's several year run.
